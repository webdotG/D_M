# Dreams and Memories

This app I had the idea to write after I realized that I knew very little about my grandmother. So I decided to record her stories that she told me. I wanted to learn as much as possible about her, but unfortunately, the time I spent with her was not enough for her to fully recall the stories from her life.

So I decided that it was time for me to start writing down my stories so that I wouldn't waste time. I have tried a number of different ways of recording, storing, and sorting my stories, and none of them have satisfied me completely.

While I was exploring different options from the technologies already available to record stories, I read the lectures and various works of the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung. I was particularly attracted by his words and thoughts on dreams, the unconscious, and self-analysis.

By the time I realized that I wanted to write my own app, I had the idea of recording not only stories and memories but also dreams and the possibility to analyze them.

That's how it turned out, and I'm happy with it.
